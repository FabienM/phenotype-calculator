# Cat Phenotype Calculator

## Description

The Cat Phenotype Calculator is a web application built with React and Typescript that allows users to calculate the potential phenotypes for the offspring of two cats of the same breed. By inputting the genetic information of the parent cats, users can visualize and understand the possible outcomes for traits such as coat color, pattern, and eye color in their kittens.
At the moment the only supported breed is Birman.

## Features

- Input fields for specifying the genetic information of two parent cats.
- Calculation of potential phenotypes for the offspring based on Mendelian genetics principles.
- Visual representation of possible coat colors and patterns for the kittens.
- User-friendly interface with clear instructions and tooltips for genetic terms.

## Technologies Used

- React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Typescript: Superset of JavaScript that adds static typing.
- HTML/CSS: Markup and styling for the web interface.
- Mendelian Genetics Algorithms: Algorithms based on Mendel's laws to calculate offspring phenotypes.
- Joy-UI and DataGrid from Material Design.

## Getting Started

To run the Cat Phenotype Calculator locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies by running `npm install`.
4. Start the development server with `npm start`.
5. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## Usage

1. Enter the genetic information for the parent cats in the provided input fields.
2. Explore the visual representation of possible coat colors and patterns for the kittens.
3. Experiment with different combinations of genetic information to see how it affects the outcomes.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
